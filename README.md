## Description

This project is a product of the second practical assignement of one of our classes: [Distributed Computing](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12273) and the main idea behind it is to implement the map/reduce algorithm in a centralized distributed system, with one coordinator and several workers processes, also having a fault tolerance mechanism.
